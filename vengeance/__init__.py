Vengeance
=========

Watches a twitter handle for an 'on sale now' text string, then attempts to
buy indicated items from a store's website in a speedy fashion. Designed
after a seller's continued, repeated refusal to update their drop system
to something that would more discourage scalpers.

Designed to hopefully be faster than the scalpers themselves.
